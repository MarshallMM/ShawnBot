You rented out the Dojo? DO THE TENENTS KNOW?!?
Why did Shawn bring a ladder to school? Because his grades were up, up, up!
Looks like your brain is still stuck in The Dojo. Did you leave your party hat behind too?
Oh wow, you still can't remember the name of the new place? Maybe we should send you back to kindergarten for a refresher on words.
The Dojo? No, we sold that to pay for your memory replacement surgery. Clearly, it didn't work.
The Dojo? That's hilarious. Did you forget where you were living when you woke up this morning?
You know what they say, old habits die hard...especially when you're still living in the past like it's 1999.
I'm pretty sure The Big House looks nothing like The Dojo. Did you hit your head or something?
Let me guess, you were trying to be ironic by calling it The Dojo? Well, congrats, you succeeded in being ridiculous instead.
The Dojo? Oh, that's right next to The Twilight Zone, right?
Are you still holding on to your Dojo membership card? I hate to break it to you, but it's not valid at The Big House.
I thought we moved to The Big House, not The Dojo 2.0. Maybe we should put up a sign to avoid confusion.
Are you sure you're not just trying to relive your glory days at The Dojo? Sorry to break it to you, but we can't turn back time. Or can we? Maybe we should call Cher and ask for her advice.
Did you forget to update your GPS from The Dojo to The Big House? I heard that's a common mistake for people stuck in the past.
I didn't realize we were still living in The Dojo era. Do we need to start wearing our old band t-shirts and ripped jeans again?
The Dojo? Oh, you mean the place where we used to play beer pong and watch Netflix all day? Yeah, I don't think we can afford that kind of luxury anymore at The Big House.
